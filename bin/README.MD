# Coding Exercise

This coding exercise is part of the application process for Greenback's Software Development Internship.

## Instructions

Please create a 'Program' that parses the index.html file in this repository and generates the JSON found in results.json

* 'Program' can be a command line script, a web app or anything else that is easily runnable
* You are not restricted on languages or technologies you use. Greenback is primarily a Java shop, but Ruby, Python, PHP, etc. are all acceptable
* If you choose to do a web app you must take index.html or its contents as a form input parameter and you must parse the HTML on the server. 
* Please generate a .json file as the output
* Do not worry about the order of the JSON objects in the results file as long as the structure is the same

## Submission instructions
* Create an account on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and create a private repo.
* Share private repo with [drouillard] (https://bitbucket.org/drouillard/)
* Please include instructions on how to run your 'Program' in your repo's README.md
